Hello, Earthlings! 

In case no one uderstood this ultra-thin reference to my favourite earthling game... I would not explain it anyway! 
I came from different star system and would like to gain any knowledge possible of your civilization. I like animals as far they are way too cute to be unlikable! 
By the way, in my opinion humans are way too strict and cruel to themselves but I hope to see them change someday!
